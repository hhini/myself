    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lesson 1: Project Setup & Data Organization**🦄\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** To understand the basic requirements and set up a structured environment for a metabolomics project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concept 1: The Necessary Tools and Data Format**\n",
    "\n",
    "In bioinformatics, especially when using open-source tools like R, we cannot work directly with the files that come off the mass spectrometer (e.g., .raw, .d). These are proprietary “closed” formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Universal Language:** The open-source community has created a universal format called **mzML**. Think of it as the PDF or JPG of mass spectrometry. It’s a standardized format that any tool can read.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Translator:** A free, essential program called **ProteoWizard** (specifically ***its msConvert tool***) is the standard for translating from proprietary formats to mzML.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The “Workbench”:** For metabolomics in R, the most important software is a package from Bioconductor called ***`xcms`*** . It is a complete ecosystem for processing metabolomics data, from the raw files to the final feature list. It is built on top of another package called `MSnbase`, which provides the fundamental tools for handling mass spec data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concept 2: The Importance of Project Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "A bioinformatics project involves many files: raw data, processed data, scripts, figures, and reports. Without a logical folder structure from the very beginning, a project can quickly become chaotic and impossible to reproduce. A clean, organized project is the hallmark of a professional bioinformatician.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Practical Application: Setting up our Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s apply these concepts to our Metformin project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Action 1: Create the Project Folders**  \n",
    "On your computer, create a main folder for the project. Inside it, create a set of sub-folders. This structure will keep everything tidy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**codeCode**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Project_HepG2_Metformin/\n",
    "    ├── data_mzML/         <-- Our converted mzML files will go here\n",
    "    ├── data_processed/    <-- Intermediate R objects we save will go here\n",
    "    ├── scripts/           <-- Our R scripts will live here\n",
    "    └── figures/           <-- The plots we generate will be saved here\n",
    "\n",
    "**Action 2: Prepare the R Environment**  \n",
    "We need to install the specialized packages. Think of this as stocking our workbench with the right tools before we start.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Open RStudio. In the console, run these commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` r\n",
    "# Install the BiocManager, which is the installer for all bioinformatics packages in R\n",
    "if (!requireNamespace(\"BiocManager\", quietly = TRUE))\n",
    "    install.packages(\"BiocManager\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now use BiocManager to install the essential metabolomics packages\n",
    "BiocManager::install(c(\"xcms\", \"MSnbase\"))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Also install the tidyverse, a collection of packages for general data science\n",
    "install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Action 3: Convert the Raw Data**  \n",
    "Let’s assume the lab has given us 10 `Thermo .raw` files. We must convert them to `mzML.`\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Open the msConvert program (from the ProteoWizard suite).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Add the 10 `.raw` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Set the output format to **mzML**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Crucially**, for metabolomics, we do **not** apply a “Peak Picking” filter here. `xcms` is designed to work with the richer “profile” data to find the faint metabolic peaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Set the output directory to your new data_mzML folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  Click “Start”.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Action 4: Set up the RStudio Project and Script**  \n",
    "To make our lives easier, we will create an RStudio Project file. This automatically manages our working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  In RStudio, go to File \\> New Project… \\> Existing Directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Browse to and select your Project_HepG2_Metformin folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  RStudio will restart and you’ll see an .Rproj file in your project folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Now, create our first script: File \\> New File \\> R Script.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Save it inside the scripts folder as 01_xcms_processing.R.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lesson 1: Summary & Status Check**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have successfully completed the foundational setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Conceptually**, we understand that we need to use an open data format (mzML) and that `xcms` is our primary tool in R for processing this data. We also understand the critical importance of an organized project folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Practically**, we have installed the necessary software, created a clean folder structure, converted our raw data, and set up our RStudio environment and our first script.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now perfectly prepared to begin the actual data processing. Every step from here on will be code that we write in our `01_xcms_processing.R` script.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lesson 2: The Core Challenge - Peak Picking & Feature Detection**🤑\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** To understand what a “feature” is in metabolomics and to use the `xcms` package in R to ***automatically*** detect these features in each of our *`LC-MS files`* individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concept 1: What Are We Looking For? The “Feature”**\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw LC-MS data is a three-dimensional landscape:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Mass-to-Charge (m/z):** Which ions are present.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Retention Time (RT):** When they come off the LC column.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Intensity:** How many of each ion there are.\n",
    "\n",
    "***A single metabolite doesn’t just appear at one point.*** As the small sample plug of a metabolite travels off the column, it elutes over a short period of time, creating a peak shape. Therefore, a **metabolic feature** is a 2D mountain in the m/z vs. RT landscape. Our goal in this lesson is to find all of these “mountains” and characterize them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concept 2: The Extracted Ion Chromatogram (EIC)(色谱图)**\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we see these peaks? Imagine you take a very thin slice of the 3D data at a specific m/z value (e.g., all signals between m/z = 129.10 and 129.11). If you then plot the intensity of that slice over time, you get an **Extracted Ion Chromatogram (EIC)**. If a metabolite with that m/z exists, you will see a classic chromatographic peak (like a small bell curve) in the EIC.\n",
    "\n",
    "The job of “peak picking” algorithms is to automatically generate thousands of these EICs and find the bell-shaped peaks within them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concept 3: The xcms Peak Picking Algorithm - centWave**\n",
    "\n",
    "xcms has several algorithms, but the most famous and widely used for high-resolution data (like ours) is called ***centWave***. It works like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  It divides the full m/z range ***into thousands of tiny, overlapping slices.***\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  For each slice, it creates an EIC.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  It then applies advanced signal processing techniques (Continuous Wavelet Transform(连续小波变换), which is where the “Wave” in the name comes from) to the EIC to ***identify regions that look like real peaks and distinguish them from random noise.***\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  For each real peak it finds, it records key information: ***its exact m/z***, ***the retention time*** at the apex of the peak, ***the peak’s integrated area*** (the most important value for quantification), and other metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is performed **independently on each of our 10 files.** For now, the algorithm doesn’t know or care that the files are related. Its only job is to generate a comprehensive list of all features found in each file, one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Practical Application: Finding Features in our Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s write the R code in our `01_xcms_processing.R` script to apply these concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Action 1: Load Libraries and Define Files**  \n",
    "The first step in our script is to load the necessary packages and tell R where to find our data files. We also need to create our “phenotype” data frame, which describes the experiment.\n",
    "\n",

    "cwp <- CentWaveParam(\n",

    "  snthresh = 10,         # Signal-to-noise ratio threshold.\n",
    "  prefilter = c(3, 100), # Prefilter for intensity. Peaks must have at least 3 points above 100 intensity.\n",
    "  mzdiff = 0.01          # Minimum difference in m/z for overlapping peaks.\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Let's look at our parameter object\n",
    "print(cwp)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Run this code.** This creates an object cwp that holds all our instructions for the centWave algorithm. This is much better than typing all the numbers into one giant function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Action 3: Run the Peak Picking!**  \n",
    "Now we apply our parameters to our raw data object. This is the first major computational step.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` r\n",
    "# --- 3. Run Peak Picking ---\n",
    "\n",
    "# The 'findChromPeaks' function does the work.\n",
    "# It takes our raw data and our parameter object as input.\n",
    "# This will take some time to run as it processes each file individually.\n",
    "xdata_peaks <- findChromPeaks(raw_data, param = cwp)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Let's inspect the results\n",
    "print(xdata_peaks)\n",
    "\n",
    "# We can also see how many peaks were found in each file\n",

    "\n",
    "# And get a summary table\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Run this code.** `xcms` is now processing your 10 files. When it’s done, the `xdata_peaks` object will contain all the original raw data PLUS the results of the peak picking. The summary table will show you how many thousands of features were detected in each sample. You should see a relatively consistent number across all 10 files, which is a good first quality check.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lesson 2: Summary & Status Check**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have made a huge leap forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Conceptually**, we understand that our goal is to find 2D peaks (features) in the m/z-RT data, and that algorithms like centWave do this by analyzing thousands of EICs. We also know that at this stage, each file is processed independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Practically**, we have loaded our data into a memory-efficient R object, defined a clear set of parameters for peak picking, and successfully executed the `findChromPeaks` function. We now have an object, xdata_peaks, that contains the locations and intensities of tens of thousands of features for each of our 10 samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem now is that the feature list for “Control_1” is completely independent of the list for “Control_2”. The next critical step is to correct for shifts in retention time so we can begin to match them up.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dont forget QC😋\n",
    "\n",
    "**QC is not only needed, it is arguably even more critical in metabolomics than in proteomics.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason is that metabolites are small, chemically diverse molecules that are much ***more sensitive*** to tiny variations in the experimental process (sample extraction, temperature, column pressure, etc.). Furthermore, the identification of metabolites is a much harder problem, so ***we rely heavily on the quality and consistency of our raw data*** (m/z and retention time) to have any confidence in our results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### QC in a Metabolomics Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t just do QC once. It’s a continuous process that you perform at multiple stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Stage 1: Before You Even Start xcms (Initial Raw Data QC)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This should be done right after loading the data in **Lesson 2, Action 1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC) - The “Heartbeat” of the Run:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Concept:** Exactly the same as in proteomics. We plot the sum of all ion intensities in every scan against the retention time.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **What it tells you:** It’s your first and best look at the stability of the LC-MS system.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **GOOD:** TICs for all 10 replicates should have ***similar shapes, peak structures, and overall intensity ranges.*** This shows the chromatography and spray stability were consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **BAD:** One sample has a TIC that is 10x lower than the others. Or a TIC shows a sudden, sharp drop to zero. These are “outlier” runs that are technical failures. You should seriously consider **removing them from the analysis** before you even start peak picking.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **How to do it in R:** The chromatogram function in MSnbase does this perfectly, just as we did in the proteomics practical section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Base Peak Chromatogram (BPC) - The “Loudest Signal”:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Concept:** Very similar to the TIC, but instead of summing all ions in a scan, it just plots the intensity of the single most intense ion.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **What it tells you:** It’s less sensitive to background noise and can sometimes ***give a clearer picture of the major chromatographic peaks***. It’s an excellent companion plot to the TIC. Consistent BPCs across replicates are a very good sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **How to do it in R:** The same `chromatogram` function is used, but with `aggregationFun = \"max\".`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Stage 2: After Peak Picking (The QC we are about to do)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once `xcms` has found the features in each file, we can perform even more powerful QC.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Total Number of Features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Concept:** The summary_peaks table we just created in Lesson 2 is a QC step!\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **What it tells you:** While not expected to be identical, the total number of features found in each replicate should be in the same ballpark. If one sample suddenly has half (or double) the number of features, it’s a major red flag that something went wrong with that specific sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Mass Accuracy - The “Ruler” of the Instrument:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Concept:** In metabolomics, we don’t have a search engine to tell us the “true” mass of a peptide like in proteomics. So, how do we check mass accuracy? We often rely on **known contaminants or internal standards**.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **What it tells you:** If you know there is always a specific plasticizer(增塑剂) contaminant with a known mass of m/z 391.2842, you can plot the measured m/z of that peak in every sample. If it’s consistently measured at 391.2840 +/- 0.0005, your mass accuracy is excellent (within a few ppm). If it’s drifting all over the place, your instrument was not stable, and your confidence in identifying unknown metabolites will be very low.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **How to do it:** This is a more manual process where you would plot the EIC of a known mass, find the peak, and check its measured m/z in each file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Consistency of Retention Times for Key Metabolites (Before Correction):**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Concept:** Pick a few well-known, abundant metabolites you expect to see (e.g., glutamine(谷氨酰胺), leucine(亮氨酸)).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **What it tells you:** Plot their EICs for all 10 samples on one graph. You will almost certainly see that their retention times are not perfectly aligned. They will drift from run to run. Seeing this drift **is the entire motivation for our next lesson (Lesson 3: Retention Time Correction).** This QC step proves why the next processing step is absolutely necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let’s Add the Code!\n",
    "\n",
    "You are so right, we should have done this. Let’s add the crucial TIC and BPC plotting code to our `01_xcms_processing.R` script. The perfect place is right after we create the raw_data object in **Action 1 of Lesson 2**.\n",

    "### **Lesson 3: Retention Time Correction**🤠\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** ***To understand why retention times vary between LC-MS runs and to use an xcms algorithm to computationally align the data, ensuring that the same metabolite appears at the same adjusted retention time in every sample.***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concept 1: The Problem - Inevitable Chromatographic Drift**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are running a marathon. Even under identical conditions, you won’t finish ten marathons in the exact same time down to the millisecond. The same is true for molecules in an LC column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of an experiment (which can take hours or days), small, unavoidable changes occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The temperature of the room can fluctuate slightly.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The pressure from the LC pumps can vary minutely.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The chromatography column itself can age and degrade.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is **retention time drift**. A metabolite that appears at 5.21 minutes in the first run might appear at 5.18 minutes in the fifth run and 5.25 minutes in the tenth run.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this a catastrophe for our analysis?**  \n",
    "Our next goal (in Lesson 4) is to group features from different samples and say, “These are all the same metabolite.” We do this by looking for features with a very similar m/z and retention time. ***If the retention times are drifting randomly, we will fail to group correctly.*** We might incorrectly split one metabolite into two separate groups, or incorrectly merge two different metabolites into one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Therefore, retention time correction is not an optional “cleanup” step. It is an absolutely essential prerequisite for correct feature grouping.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concept 2: The Solution - Alignment Algorithms**\n",
    "\n",
    "`xcms` uses powerful algorithms to fix this drift. The goal is to create a “warping” function(扭曲函数) for each sample that shifts its retention time axis to match a reference (often a “virtual” average of all samples).\n",
    "\n",
    "A common and robust algorithm is **`obiwarp`** (Ordered Bijective Interpolated Warping). You don’t need to know the deep mathematics, but conceptually, it works like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  It creates a “consensus”(共识) signal by averaging all the TICs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  For each individual sample’s TIC, it finds the optimal way to stretch and squeeze its time axis to make it align perfectly with the consensus signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  It saves this “warping” function. Later, it will apply this exact same transformation to all the features that were detected in that sample.\n",
    "\n",

    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lesson 4: Feature Grouping (or “Correspondence”)🧐\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** ***To understand how xcms groups individual features from all 10 samples into “feature groups,” where each group represents a single, unique metabolic compound measured across the experiment.***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concept 1: The Problem - From Many Lists to One Matrix**\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, our xdata_aligned object contains 10 separate lists of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   File 1 has a feature at (m/z=130.06, RT=2.51 min)\n",

    "-   File 3 has a feature at (m/z=130.06, RT=2.50 min)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   …and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to create a final data matrix where the **rows are unique compounds** and the **columns are our samples**. To do this, we need to figure out that the three features listed above are very likely measurements of the same compound.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of finding and linking these corresponding features is called **grouping** or **correspondence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concept 2: The Solution - Grouping by Proximity**\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we decide which features belong together? We look for features that are “close” to each other in the chemical space we have just worked so hard to clean up:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Mass-to-Charge (m/z):** The m/z values must be very similar, within the known mass accuracy of our instrument (e.g., within 5 ppm).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Retention Time (RT):** The aligned retention times must also be very close, within a small window.\n",
    "\n",
    "The grouping algorithm in `xcms` essentially creates a “search window” around each feature and looks for other features from different samples that fall within that m/z and RT window.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common algorithm for this uses a **density-based approach**. Imagine plotting all the features from all 10 samples as points on a 2D graph of m/z vs. RT***. The features that belong to the same compound will form a tight, dense cluster of points***. The algorithm’s job is to find these dense regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concept 3: “Trust, but Verify” - How Do We Check the Grouping?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This step is harder to verify with a single plot, but there are key metrics and visualizations we can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Feature Group Summaries:** We can check how many of our final feature groups contain a peak from only 1 sample, 2 samples, … up to all 10 samples. A good grouping should result in a large number of feature groups that contain peaks from most, if not all, of the samples within at least one condition (e.g., all 5 Control samples). A very high number of “singleton” groups (found in only one sample) might indicate the parameters were too strict.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Extracted Ion Chromatogram (EIC) of a Feature Group:** This is the most powerful verification. We can pick a single, final feature group from our results and ask xcms to plot the raw chromatograms for that specific m/z and RT range for all 10 samples. A well-grouped feature should show a clean, aligned peak in most, if not all, of the samples. This confirms that the algorithm correctly grouped the signals.\n",

    "### Lesson 5: Filling Missing Peaks 🥩\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Goal :** *Our goal is to address the issue of missing values in our feature table. The `groupChromPeaks` function linked features across samples, but some samples within a group may not have had a peak detected by the `findChromPeaks` algorithm. We want to go back to the raw data for those specific samples and integrate the signal in the exact location where the peak should be, giving us a more complete data matrix for statistical analysis.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Underlying Logic**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Why are peaks “missing”?** A peak might be “missing” for two main reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  **True Absence:** The metabolite is simply not present or is below the instrument’s detection limit in that sample. This is a biologically meaningful result.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.  **Technical Absence:** The metabolite was present, but its ***signal was too low,*** too noisy, or too poorly shaped to be picked by the `findChromPeaks` algorithm, which had a strict signal-to-noise threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Problem:** Standard statistical tests (like t-tests) cannot handle missing values (NA). Simply ignoring them or replacing them with zero is statistically invalid and throws away valuable information. A zero is a measured value; an NA means we don’t know.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Solution (fillChromPeaks):** The grouping step (Lesson 4) has given us a very precise map. For a given feature group, we know the exact m/z and the aligned retention time range where that metabolite appears in the samples where it was detected. The `fillChromPeaks` function uses this map. For every sample where a peak is missing within that group, it ***goes back to the original raw data file*** for that sample, extracts the chromatogram for that precise m/z and RT window, and integrates the signal there.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   ***If there was a small, real peak that was missed, it will be integrated and we get a good quantitative value***.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   If there was only noise, it will ***integrate the noise,*** resulting in a very small, near-zero value, which is a much more accurate representation than a complete NA.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **2. Underlying Logic**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Problem:** A single metabolite, “M,” does not produce a single peak in the mass spectrometer. Due to natural isotope abundance and the chemistry of electrospray(电喷雾) ionization(电离), ***it will generate a whole family of related peaks.***\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **Isotopes:** You’ll see the ***main peak*** (M), the M+1 peak (with one ¹³C atom), the M+2 peak (with two ¹³C atoms), etc. `xcms` will likely have ***picked all of these as separate features.***\n",

    "-   **Crucially**, we have followed the “Trust, but Verify” principle by extracting the peak list and inspecting a single “pseudospectrum,” confirming that the features within it have the expected properties (same RT, different m/z, plausible adduct/isotope assignments).\n",
    "\n",
    "We have now reached a major milestone. Our data is as clean and well-structured as it can be. We are finally ready to assemble the final data matrix for our statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lesson 7: Building the Final Data Matrix & Normalization🦪\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Goal**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goals for this lesson are twofold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **To build the final data matrix:** We will extract the ***quantitative information (peak intensities)*** from our processed object and ***create a table where the rows represent our unique compounds*** (using the `pcgroup` annotation from `CAMERA`) and the columns represent our 10 samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **To normalize the data:** We will apply a normalization method to this matrix to correct for unavoidable technical variations between samples (e.g., slight differences in sample loading or instrument sensitivity over time). This ensures that the differences we see are biological, not technical.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Underlying Logic**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Why build a new matrix?** The `xcms` and `CAMERA` objects are complex and contain all the raw data. For statistics, we need a simple rows x columns matrix of numbers. Furthermore, we need to resolve the redundancy identified by CAMERA. If multiple features (e.g., \\[M+H\\]⁺ and \\[M+Na\\]⁺) belong to the same `pcgroup`, we should ***represent them with a single row*** in our final matrix, typically by choosing the most intense and reliable feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Why is normalization essential?** Imagine you pipette 99 microliters of sample A but 101 microliters of sample B into the instrument vials. Every single metabolite in sample B would appear to be ~2% more abundant. This is purely technical variation. Normalization aims to correct for these kinds of global, systematic shifts. It assumes that most metabolites do not change between your samples, and it adjusts the intensity scales of each sample so that the bulk of the metabolites line up.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **A Common Normalization Method (PQN):** **Probabilistic Quotient Normalization (PQN(概率商归一化)** is a robust and widely used method. Conceptually, it works like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  It calculates a “reference” spectrum (typically the median spectrum across all samples).\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.  For each individual sample, it calculates the fold-change for every metabolite relative to this reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.  It finds the median of all these fold-changes for that sample. This median value is the most likely “scaling factor” or technical error for that run.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4.  It then divides all metabolite intensities in that sample by this scaling factor, bringing its overall intensity in line with all the other samples.\n",

    "### Lesson 8: Univariate(单变量) and Multivariate(多变量) Statistics🤗\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** To analyze our final data matrix `(matrix_log2)` to identify which `specific metabolites have significantly changed in abundance between the Control and Metformin-treated groups`. We will use two complementary statistical approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Underlying Logic**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data matrix has many rows (thousands of metabolites) and is therefore “high-dimensional.” We can’t just look at it and see the patterns. We need two types of statistical tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Multivariate Analysis (The “Forest” View):** This approach looks at all metabolites at once to find the dominant patterns of variation in the data. Its primary purpose is **unsupervised clustering**. It answers the question: “Based on their overall metabolic profile, do my samples naturally group together by their condition (Control vs. Metformin)?” This is a powerful, unbiased first look at our data and a critical QC step. The most common method for this is **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **How PCA Works:** PCA finds the “principal components,” which are new, artificial axes that capture the maximum amount of variation in the data. PC1 is the axis that explains the most variation, PC2 explains the second most, and so on. By plotting the samples on these new axes (a “scores plot”), we can see if the dominant source of variation in our experiment corresponds to our biological question.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   ***PCA (and other multivariate methods like PLS-DA) is for HOLISTIC PATTERN RECOGNITION AND QC.(整体识别和QC).PCA do confirm the experiment worked.***\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Univariate Analysis (The “Trees” View):** This approach looks at one metabolite at a time. For each and every row in our matrix, it performs a statistical test to ask: “Is the mean intensity of this metabolite in the Control group significantly different from its mean in the Metformin group?” This is how we find our list of individual “hits.”\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **The Tool:** We will use the same powerhouse package from our proteomics project: **`limma`**. It is perfect for this task because it handles the multiple testing problem effectively and is statistically more powerful than running thousands of individual t-tests. The output will be a p-value and a fold-change for every single metabolite.\n",

    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson 9: Metabolite Identification and Annotation (The Deeper Dive)🤠\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Goal**\n",
    "\n",
    "***Our goal is to take the list of significant features from our statistical analysis and assign a putative(假定的) chemical identity to them. This involves `querying online databases` with the highly accurate mass of our features to find potential matches. We must also understand the different levels of confidence in these identifications.***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Underlying Logic**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Challenge:** ***Unlike proteomics, where peptides are made from a simple 20-letter amino acid alphabet,*** the chemical space of metabolites is astronomically ***vast and diverse***. ***There is no simple “search engine” that can definitively identify a metabolite from its mass alone.***\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Primary Clue: Accurate Mass.** Our most powerful piece of information is the ***very precise mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) that we measured.*** For a feature like “M175.0234T3.45”, the key is the mass: 175.0234. We can search ***databases*** to ask, “***What known biological molecules have a mass that is extremely close to this value?“***\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Problem of Adducts:** Remember **`CAMERA`**? It told us that a feature might be the protonated form \\[M+H\\]⁺, or a sodium adduct \\[M+Na\\]⁺, etc. When we search a database, we must search for the mass of the **neutral molecule (M)(中性分子)**. Therefore, before searching, we must first “de-adduct” our measured m/z.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   If we believe our feature 175.0234 is the \\[M+H\\]⁺ form, the ***neutral mass is 175.0234 - (mass of a proton) = 174.0156.***\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   If we believe it is the \\[M+Na\\]⁺ form, the neutral mass is 175.0234 - (mass of a sodium ion) = 152.0368.  \n",
    "        This is why the **`CAMERA`** annotation step was so important.\n",
    "\n",
    "        CAMERA (Collection of Algorithms for MEtabolite pRofile Annotation) doesn’t “know” in the strict sense—it infers based on **mass differences**, **intensity patterns**, and **co-elution behavior**. Here’s how:\n",
    "\n",
    "        #### 1. **Co-elution and Retention Time**\n",
    "\n",
    "        -   CAMERA starts by clustering features that elute at nearly the same retention time.\n",
    "\n",
    "        -   The assumption: if two ions appear at the same time, they likely come from the same compound.\n",
    "\n",
    "        #### 2. **Mass Differences Matching Known Adducts**\n",
    "\n",
    "        -   It uses a predefined list of adducts (e.g., \\[M+H\\]⁺, \\[M+Na\\]⁺, \\[M+K\\]⁺) and their exact mass shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "        -   If two features differ by the mass of a sodium ion minus a proton (~21.9819 Da)(两个特性相减得到一个质子), and they co-elute, CAMERA flags them as possible \\[M+H\\]⁺ and \\[M+Na\\]⁺ forms of the same molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "        #### 3. **Isotope Patterns**\n",
    "\n",
    "        -   It checks for isotopic spacing (e.g., 1.00335 Da for C13) and intensity ratios.\n",
    "\n",
    "        -   This helps distinguish monoisotopic peaks from their heavier isotopologues.\n",
    "\n",
    "        #### 4. **Intensity Ratios and Charge States**\n",
    "\n",
    "        -   Adducts often have characteristic intensity patterns. For example, \\[M+H\\]⁺ is usually more abundant than \\[M+Na\\]⁺.\n",
    "\n",
    "        -   CAMERA uses these patterns to refine its grouping.\n",
    "\n",
    "        ### 🧠 Why “De-adducting” Is Necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "        When you search a database like HMDB or METLIN, they expect the **neutral mass (M)**, not the m/z of the adduct. So CAMERA helps you:\n",
    "\n",
    "        -   Group all adducts and isotopes of a compound.\n",
    "\n",
    "        -   Infer the neutral mass by subtracting the adduct mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "        -   Output a cleaned list of neutral masses for annotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "        ### 🧰 Example\n",
    "\n",
    "        Let’s say you detect three features:\n",
    "\n",
    "        -   m/z 180.065 (RT 5.2 min)\n",
    "\n",
    "        -   m/z 201.045 (RT 5.2 min)\n",
    "\n",
    "        -   m/z 181.068 (RT 5.2 min)\n",
    "\n",
    "        CAMERA sees:\n",
    "\n",
    "        -   180.065 could be \\[M+H\\]⁺\n",
    "\n",
    "        -   201.045 is ~21.98 Da higher → likely \\[M+Na\\]⁺\n",
    "\n",
    "        -   181.068 is ~1.003 Da higher → likely C13 isotope of \\[M+H\\]⁺\n",
    "\n",
    "        It bundles them, assigns a neutral mass of ~179.057, and tags the adducts accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Levels of Identification Confidence:** The Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI) has defined a clear, tiered system for reporting identifications. It is crucial to be honest about our level of confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **Level 4: Unidentified Compound.** This is our current state: a feature with a mass and RT, but no name.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **Level 3: Putatively Characterized Compound Class.** (e.g., based on spectral data, we might guess it’s a type of sugar).\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **Level 2: Putatively Annotated Compound.** This is our goal for today. We get a match based on accurate mass from a database (e.g., M174.0156 is a perfect match for the neutral mass of Arginine). This is a strong hypothesis, but not a confirmation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **Level 1: Confidently Identified Compound.** This is the gold standard. To achieve this, you must match **two** orthogonal properties(正交属性), most commonly:\n",
    "\n",
    "        1.  Accurate mass and retention time against a ***pure, purchased chemical standard run on the exact same machine.***\n",
    "\n",
    "        2.  Accurate mass and its MS/MS fragmentation spectrum against a library spectrum from a pure standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our untargeted bioinformatics analysis, we will be operating at **Level 2**. We are generating high-quality hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Practical Application: The Code**\n",

    "We will now go to an external database, like the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) and manually verify this. Let’s say the top hit is “L-Glutamine(谷氨酰胺)”.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Google “HMDB L-Glutamine”.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  On the HMDB page, find the exact monoisotopic mass of the neutral molecule(单同位素质量数). (For L-Glutamine, this is 146.0691 g/mol).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Now, let’s calculate what the mass of the \\[M+H\\]+ adduct should be. Mass of a proton is ~1.007276 Da. Expected \\[M+H\\]+ mass = 146.0691 + 1.007276 = 147.0764 Da.\n",

    "\n",
    "This concept is identical to the enrichment analysis we performed in proteomics.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Problem:** We might have a list of 50 significant metabolites. Simply reading the list (e.g., “Glutamine is down, Citrate is up, Succinate is up…”) doesn’t immediately tell us the story.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Question:** Are these changes random, or ***are they concentrated in a specific, coordinated biological process?***\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Method (Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis - MSEA(代谢物集富集分析)):** We use a statistical test (the **`hypergeometric test`**, just like before) to check if our list of 50 “hits” contains a surprisingly high number of metabolites belonging to a predefined “Metabolite Set” (like the “Citric Acid (TCA) Cycle” pathway). If the probability of seeing that many hits in that pathway by random chance is very low (i.e., a small p-value), ***we can conclude that the pathway is “significantly enriched” or “significantly impacted.”***\n",

    "-   **Verification:** The plot itself is the proof. ***You have a clear, publication-ready figure that summarizes the entire biological story of your experiment.*** It visually confirms the findings from the results table. For example, if “Citric Acid (TCA) Cycle” has the biggest bar, you have strong evidence that Metformin’s primary effect is on the cell’s central energy production.\n",

    "Let’s synthesize the story from this final lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **From Hits to Names:** In Lesson 9, we turned our significant feature list (e.g., “M117.0189…”) into a list of putative metabolite names (e.g., “Succinic acid”).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **From Names to Pathways:** In this lesson, we took that list of names and discovered they weren’t random. Our enrichment analysis showed, for instance, that “Succinic acid,” “Citric acid,” “Malic acid,” and “Fumaric acid” were all significantly upregulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **The Biological Story:** The enrichment plot tells us that these metabolites are not just a random collection; they are all key players in the **“Citric Acid (TCA) Cycle.”**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Final Hypothesis:**  \n",
    "“Our untargeted metabolomics analysis reveals that Metformin treatment significantly perturbs(扰乱) central carbon metabolism in `HepG2` cells. We observed a statistically significant enrichment of the Citric Acid (TCA) Cycle pathway, driven by the coordinated upregulation of multiple key cycle intermediates. This suggests that Metformin’s anti-cancer effects in this model may be mediated by altering the cell’s fundamental energy production pathways.”"
