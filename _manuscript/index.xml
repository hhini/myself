    <title>Genome Wide Association Studies Definition</title>
    <p>Genome-Wide Association Studies, abbreviated as GWAS, represent a
    scientific methodology aimed at elucidating(ÈòêÊòé) potential
    associations between genetic loci, namely the genome, and specific
    traits or diseases. Through meticulous analysis of millions, even
    tens of millions, of genetic variations within an organism‚Äôs genome,
    GWAS endeavors to identify genetic loci significantly associated
    with particular phenotypes or diseases.</p>

      <title>Data collection</title>
      <p>DNA samples are systematically collected from individuals,
      along with recording their phenotypic information, which includes
      demographic data such as possible disease conditions, age, and
      gender.</p>
      <p>For GWAS, typically large sample sizes are required to identify
      reproducible genome-wide significant association loci. Determining
      sample sizes can be facilitated(ËæÖÂä©) using software tools such as
      CATS or GPC. The phenotypes involved can be either binary traits
      or quantitative traits. Additionally, the study design can be
      population-based or family-based.</p>

    <sec id="genetyping">
      <title>Genetyping</title>
      <p>Genotyping of each individual‚Äôs genes is carried out using
      existing GWAS arrays or sequencing strategies.</p>
      <p>Microarray technology is commonly employed for genotyping
      <bold>common variants</bold>, or next-generation sequencing
      methods such as WES or WGS are utilized to cover <bold>rare
      variants</bold>. Given the high cost of WGS (whole genome
      sequencing), genotyping based on microarrays is currently the most
      commonly used method. However, WGS theoretically allows for the
      determination of nearly every genotype in the entire genome, and
      thus, with the ongoing development of low-cost WGS technologies,
      it is expected to become the mainstream method in the coming
      years.</p>

            <list-item>
              <p>For a GWAS, we don‚Äôt typically sequence the entire
              genome for every person, as that would be too expensive
              and slow for large cohorts. Instead, we use a technology
              called a <bold>genotyping array(Âü∫Âõ†ÂàÜÂûãÊäÄÊúØ)</bold>.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>Think of an array as a small glass slide or ‚Äúchip‚Äù with
              a grid containing millions of microscopic probes.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>Each probe is a short, synthetic piece of DNA designed
              to stick to a specific, known SNP location in the human
              genome.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>When an individual‚Äôs DNA is washed over this chip, the
              DNA fragments bind to their matching probes. A laser
              scanner then reads which version of the SNP (which allele)
              is present at each location based on a fluorescent
              signal.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>The output of this scanning process is a set of raw
              intensity files (e.g., .IDAT files from Illumina arrays).
              These files are then processed by specialized software
              (like Illumina‚Äôs GenomeStudio) to ‚Äúcall‚Äù the genotype for
              each person at each SNP.</p>

      <p>In a GWAS, we have data for hundreds of thousands or millions
      of SNPs. You can think of this as a dataset with a million
      dimensions‚Äîfar too complex for a human to visualize.</p>
      <p><bold>PCA is a dimensionality-reduction technique.</bold> Its
      goal is to distill this vast complexity into a few, highly
      informative new dimensions called <bold>Principal Components
      (PCs)</bold>.</p>

        <p>¬†It was a cloudy and misty day. Those birds formed a
        significance threshold line. And the skyscrapers above that line
        resembled the significant signals in your GWAS. I believe you

        This transformation is purely for visualization. A very small,

        number (-log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(10‚Åª¬π‚Å∞) = 10), making it appear high up on the

      <title>Part 1: The ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù - Most GWAS Hits Are Not Obvious</title>
      <p>A common misconception is that a GWAS will point directly to a
      ‚Äúsmoking gun(Á°ÆÂáøËØÅÊçÆ)‚Äù mutation inside a gene that breaks a
      protein. The reality, revealed by thousands of GWAS, is that
      <bold>over 90% of significant GWAS hits fall in non-coding regions
      of the genome</bold> (introns or the vast spaces between
      genes).</p>
      <p>This means they <bold>don‚Äôt change the protein sequence
      directly</bold>. Instead, they are much more likely to affect
      <bold>gene regulation</bold>‚Äîthe complex system that controls
      when, where, and how much of a gene is turned on or off.
      Annotation is our key to deciphering these regulatory effects.</p>

        <p><bold>An Important Caveat (A Real-World ‚ÄúGotcha‚Äù):</bold>
        PLINK 1.9 sometimes has trouble knowing which allele is REF and
        which is ALT because the .bim file format doesn‚Äôt inherently
        store that information relative to a reference genome. When it
        creates the VCF, it might make a guess. Modern tools like
        <bold>PLINK 2.0</bold> and its .pgen format handle this much
        more robustly. For precise work, it‚Äôs always good practice to
        double-check that the REF allele in your VCF file matches the
        actual reference genome (like GRCh38), but for a standard
        workflow, the PLINK conversion is the accepted and correct first
        step.</p>
        <p><bold>Workflow using VEP:</bold></p>
        <p><bold>Step 1: Prepare Your Input File</bold></p>
        <p>First, you need to isolate your top hits. You will filter
        your summary statistics file to get a list of independent,
        genome-wide significant SNPs. For each SNP, you need the
        following information: Chromosome, Position, ID (rsID),
        Reference Allele, and Alternative Allele. This is often
        formatted into a standard file type called a <bold>VCF (Variant
        Call Format)</bold> file.</p>
        <p><bold>Step 2: Run the Annotation Tool</bold></p>
        <p>You can use the VEP web interface for a small number of SNPs,
        but for a real project, you use the command-line version.</p>
        <p>A typical VEP command might look like this:</p>
        <code language="bash">vep --input_file my_gwas_hits.vcf \
    --output_file annotated_hits.tsv \

        <p>When your GWAS identifies a significant locus, your Manhattan

        <p>Imagine a segment of a chromosome is like a ‚Äúblock‚Äù of text

        broken up by recombination.</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Let‚Äôs say a single SNP within this block‚Äîwe‚Äôll call it
            the <bold>Causal Variant (CV)</bold>‚Äîis the one that
            actually has a biological effect on the disease. For
            instance, it might disrupt a transcription factor binding
            site.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Now, imagine there are 100 other ‚Äúpassenger‚Äù SNPs in this
            same inherited block. These SNPs have no biological function
            themselves, but because they are always ‚Äúhitchhiking‚Äù with

            association with the disease.</p>

        <p>The GWAS result (the p-value) cannot tell these SNPs apart.
        It‚Äôs like seeing a car speeding down the highway; you know the
        car is moving fast, but you don‚Äôt know who is actually pressing

        conceptually walk through how a tool like <bold>FINEMAP</bold>
        or <bold>SuSiE</bold> works.</p>
        <p><bold>The Underlying Assumption:</bold> For most GWAS loci,
        we assume there is likely only <bold>one</bold> (or maybe a
        small number) of true causal variants within the region.</p>
        <p><bold>The Process:</bold></p>
        <list list-type="order">
          <list-item>
            <p><bold>Hypothesis Generation:</bold> The algorithm

              <list-item>

              <list-item>
                <p>More advanced models (like SuSiE) can also test

            <p><bold>Likelihood Calculation:</bold> For each hypothesis,

            LD matrix, if Hypothesis 1 were true, what pattern of
            Z-scores would we expect to see across all the SNPs? And how

            from our GWAS summary statistics?‚Äù A hypothesis that

        <p>The simple sum above is a bit too naive. If you just add up
        all the SNPs from a GWAS, you‚Äôll get a poor result due to LD
        (counting the same signal multiple times) and noisy, non-zero
        effect sizes for non-associated SNPs. We need to refine the
        blueprint. This is where different PRS methods diverge.</p>
        <p><bold>Method 1: Clumping and Thresholding (C+T)</bold> - The
        Classic Approach
        This is a two-step process to select a smaller, more robust set

            iterates through the GWAS results, starting with the most
            significant SNP. It identifies all other nearby SNPs that
            are in high LD (e.g., r¬≤ &gt; 0.1) with this lead SNP and
            removes them. It then moves to the next most significant SNP
            and repeats the process. The result is a set of largely

            (e.g., a PRS using SNPs with p &lt; 5e-8, another with p
            &lt; 1e-4, another with p &lt; 0.1, etc.). You would then
            test which of these scores performs best at predicting the

        Score to Stratification</title>
        <p>The raw PRS number (e.g., 0.18) is meaningless on its own.
        Its power comes from seeing where an individual falls relative
        to a population.</p>
        <list list-type="order">
          <list-item>
            <p><bold>Standardization:</bold> You calculate the PRS for
            thousands of individuals in a reference population. This
            creates a distribution of scores, which is typically a bell
            curve (a normal distribution). The raw scores are then
            standardized (converted to a Z-score) so we can talk about
            percentiles.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><bold>Risk Stratification:</bold> Now we can interpret
            Jane‚Äôs score. If her standardized score places her at the
            <bold>95th percentile</bold>, it means her calculated
            genetic risk is higher than 95% of the population.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><bold>Clinical Utility:</bold> This is where the real
            potential lies. Studies have shown that for diseases like
            coronary artery disease(ÂøÉÂÜ†), individuals in the top 5% of
            the PRS distribution can have a <bold>3 to 4 times higher
            lifetime risk</bold> compared to those with an average
            score.</p>

        <p><bold>Crucially, a PRS is not deterministic.</bold> A high
        PRS for heart disease does not mean you will get it. It means
        your baseline genetic risk is high, making it even more
        important to manage modifiable risk factors like diet, exercise,
        and cholesterol. The power of a PRS is in identifying these
        high-risk individuals early so they can be targeted for more
        intensive screening and preventative care.</p>

        <p>This is one of the oldest and most difficult challenges in
        medical research. We frequently observe that a specific risk
        factor (an ‚Äúexposure‚Äù) is associated with a disease (an
        ‚Äúoutcome‚Äù).</p>
        <p><bold>Classic Example:</bold></p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Observational studies show that people with <bold>higher
            levels of HDL cholesterol(È´òÂØÜÂ∫¶ËÑÇËõãÁôΩËÉÜÂõ∫ÈÜá)</bold> (‚Äúgood‚Äù
            cholesterol) have a <bold>lower risk of heart
            attack</bold></p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><bold>The obvious Conclusion:</bold> Low HDL cholesterol
            causes heart attacks.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><bold>The Drug Development:</bold> This led
            pharmaceutical companies to spend billions of dollars
            developing drugs that raise HDL cholesterol levels.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><bold>The Surprising Result:</bold> The drugs worked‚Äîthey
            successfully raised HDL levels. However, they had <bold>zero
            effect</bold> on reducing heart attacks.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p><bold>What went wrong?</bold> The initial observation was a
        classic case of confounding. The same healthy lifestyle choices
        (good diet, exercise) that lead to high HDL also protect against
        heart attacks through other mechanisms. The HDL level itself
        wasn‚Äôt the causal factor; it was just a correlated marker of a
        healthy lifestyle.</p>
        <p>We needed a way to test for causality that wasn‚Äôt biased by
        these lifestyle and environmental confounders. Mendelian
        Randomization is that method.</p>

        <title>Section 3.2: The Concept - Nature‚Äôs Randomized Controlled
        Trial</title>
        <p>The central idea of MR is to leverage the random process of
        genetic inheritance. When you are conceived(ÊÄÄÂ≠ï), the
        combination of genes you inherit from your parents is
        essentially random. This is <bold>Mendel‚Äôs Law of Independent
        Assortment(Â≠üÂæ∑Â∞îÁöÑÁã¨Á´ãÂàÜÈÖçÂÆöÂæã)</bold>.</p>
        <p>This randomization acts like a perfect, lifelong
        <bold>Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)</bold>:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Some people, by pure chance, inherit a set of genetic
            variants that predispose them to having slightly higher
            cholesterol levels throughout their lives (the ‚Äútreatment
            group‚Äù).</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Other people, by pure chance, inherit variants that
            predispose them to lower cholesterol levels (the ‚Äúcontrol
            group‚Äù).</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>Because these genes were assigned randomly at conception,
        they should not be correlated(Ê∑∑Ê∑Ü) with other lifestyle factors
        (like diet, smoking, or socioeconomic status) that could
        confound the relationship between cholesterol and heart
        disease.</p>
        <p>Therefore, if the ‚Äútreatment group‚Äù (genetically higher
        cholesterol) consistently shows a higher rate of heart attacks
        than the ‚Äúcontrol group‚Äù (genetically lower cholesterol), we can
        infer that the higher cholesterol is likely
        <bold>causally</bold> related to the heart attacks.</p>

        <title>Section 3.3: The Method - The Instrumental Variable
        Framework</title>
        <p>To perform an MR analysis, we need a <bold>genetic
        instrument</bold>. This is a SNP (or, more powerfully, a set of
        SNPs) that serves as a reliable and clean proxy for the exposure
        we want to test.</p>
        <p>This genetic instrument must satisfy three core

        <list list-type="order">
          <list-item>
            <p><bold>The Relevance Assumption:</bold> The SNP must
            <bold><italic>be strongly and robustly associated with the
            exposure.</italic></bold> (e.g., we use SNPs from a GWAS of
            cholesterol levels that are genome-wide significant).</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><bold>The Independence Assumption:</bold> The SNP must
            not be associated with any confounders of the
            exposure-outcome relationship. (This is generally assumed to
            be true because of the randomization of genetic
            inheritance).</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><bold>The Exclusion Restriction Assumption:</bold> The
            SNP can only affect the outcome through the exposure. It
            cannot have an independent, alternative biological pathway
            to the outcome.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p><bold>Violation of Assumption #3</bold> is the biggest
        potential pitfall(Èô∑Èò±) of MR. This is called <bold>horizontal
        pleiotropy(Ê∞¥Âπ≥Âü∫Âõ†Â§öÊïàÊÄß)</bold> (from pleio, meaning ‚Äúmany
        effects‚Äù). For example, <italic>if a SNP that raises cholesterol
        also happens to increase blood pressure through a completely
        separate biological mechanism, then we can no longer be sure if
        the effect on heart disease is coming from the cholesterol or
        the blood pressure pathway. There are many advanced statistical
        tests to check for and correct for potential
        pleiotropy.</italic></p>
