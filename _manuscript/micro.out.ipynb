    "### **Lesson 1: The Core Concepts & Project Setup😇**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** ***`To understand the fundamental principles of 16S sequencing, grasp the key terminology, and set up a structured R project with the necessary tools and data.`***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Core Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **What is the 16S rRNA Gene?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Think of it as a universal “barcode” for bacteria and archaea(古细菌).\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   It’s a gene that codes for a component of the ribosome(编码核糖体), the cell’s protein-making machinery.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Every bacterium has this gene, so ***it’s a universal target***.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Crucially, the gene has a unique structure: it contains both **“conserved” regions(保守区域)** (nearly identical in all bacteria) and **“hypervariable” regions(高变区域)** (which are different between species).\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **The Strategy:** We design ***PCR primers that stick to the conserved regions to amplify*** (make millions of copies of) ***the hypervariable regions in between*** (e.g., the “V4” region). ***The sequence of this hypervariable region acts as a barcode to identify the bacterium***.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **What is an “Amplicon”?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   An amplicon is the piece of DNA that is created by the PCR amplification. In our case, it’s the ~250 base pair fragment of the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S gene. Our sequencing machine will generate millions of reads of these amplicons.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **What is a `.fastq` file?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   This is the raw output file from an Illumina sequencer. It’s a text file that contains information for every single read. Each read is represented by four lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "        1.  **Line 1:** Starts with @, a unique name/identifier for the read.\n",
    "\n",
    "        2.  **Line 2:** The raw DNA sequence (the “barcode”).\n",
    "\n",
    "        3.  **Line 3:** Starts with +, sometimes contains the name again.\n",
    "\n",
    "        4.  **Line 4:** The **Phred Quality Scores**. This is a string of characters (like F#\\$JJJ…) that represents the machine’s confidence in each base call in the sequence on Line 2. A is low quality, F is high quality. **This quality information is absolutely essential for our analysis.**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Central Challenge: Errors.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   No sequencing machine is perfect. It will make mistakes (e.g., read an ‘A’ when it should be a ‘G’). If we have two sequences that differ by a single nucleotide, is that a real, rare species, or is it just a sequencing error of a common species? ***Distinguishing true biological variation from technical error is the primary goal of the upstream processing pipeline***.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Extending Knowledge: 16S vs. Shotgun**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the perfect time to solidify the distinction.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let’s assume the lab has given us raw sequencing data for a study on the gut microbiome of mice, comparing “Wild Type” (WT) mice to “Knockout” (KO) mice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Action 1: Install the Key Packages**  \n",
    "The entire modern 16S workflow in R is built around two packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`dada2`:** Our upstream engine. It will handle everything from filtering raw reads to generating the final, error-corrected ASV table and assigning taxonomy.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`phyloseq`:** Our downstream analysis and visualization tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RStudio, run these commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "**codeR**\n",
    "\n",
    "    if (!requireNamespace(\"BiocManager\", quietly = TRUE))\n",
    "        install.packages(\"BiocManager\")\n",

    "    BiocManager::install(\"phyloseq\")\n",
    "    install.packages(\"tidyverse\") # For data manipulation and plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Action 2: Create the Project Structure and Get Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Create a main project folder: `Project_Microbiome_Mouse.`\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Inside, create sub-folders: `data_fastq,` *scripts*, `figures`, `data_processed`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  In RStudio, create a new R Project in this main folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Get the data:** We will use a well-known tutorial dataset that is perfect for this. In your `01_dada2_pipeline.R` script (which you should create in the scripts folder), run the following code to download the example data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **codeR**\n",
    "\n",
    "        # This code downloads the tutorial data from the web and places it in a new folder\n",
    "        # called 'MiSeq_SOP' inside your project.\n",
    "        download.file(\"https://mothur.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/data/MiSeq_SOP.zip\", \"MiSeq_SOP.zip\")\n",
    "        unzip(\"MiSeq_SOP.zip\")\n",
    "        file.rename(\"MiSeq_SOP/raw_data\", \"data_fastq\") # Move the data to our folder\n",
    "        # Clean up the downloaded/unzipped files\n",
    "        unlink(c(\"MiSeq_SOP.zip\", \"MiSeq_SOP\"), recursive = TRUE)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   After running this, your data`_fastq` folder will be populated with 20 `.fastq.gz` files. These are paired-end reads (`Forward _R1_ and Reverse _R2_`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lesson 1: Summary & Status Check**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Conceptually**, we understand that 16S sequencing is a “barcode”-based method to perform a census of a microbial community. We know that the raw data comes in FASTQ format, which contains essential quality scores, and that the primary bioinformatics challenge is to overcome sequencing errors. We have also clearly distinguished this approach from the more comprehensive shotgun metagenomics.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Practically**, we have installed the cornerstone packages for microbiome analysis (`dada2, phyloseq`), set up a clean and organized project directory, and downloaded the raw `FASTQ` files that we will use for the rest of our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now perfectly positioned to take the first and most critical step in handling raw sequencing data: inspecting its quality and filtering out the low-quality reads.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lesson 2: Quality Control and Filtering🤗**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** To visualize the quality scores of our raw sequencing reads, identify potential problems, and use `dada2` to trim low-quality bases and filter out entire reads that do not meet our quality standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Core Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **What is a Phred Quality Score (Q-score)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   It’s a compact way to represent the ***probability of an error***. The score is logarithmically scaled(对数缩放).\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **Q20:** Means a 1 in 100 chance of an incorrect base call (99% accuracy). This is generally considered the minimum acceptable quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **Q30:** Means a 1 in 1000 chance of an incorrect base call (99.9% accuracy). This is considered very good.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **Q40:** Means a 1 in 10,000 chance of an incorrect base call (99.99% accuracy). This is excellent.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   The characters in Line 4 of a FASTQ file correspond to these numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Typical Quality Profile of an Illumina Run:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Sequencing quality is not uniform across the length of a read.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   It is typically very high at the beginning of the read.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   It gradually ***degrades towards the end of the read***. This ***decay is more pronounced in the reverse reads (\\_R2\\_) than the forward reads (\\_R1\\_).(降解在反向读取比在正向读取更加明显)***\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   This pattern is a known and expected artifact of the sequencing chemistry. Our job is to identify the point where the quality drops below an acceptable threshold (like Q30) and trim the reads at that position.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Filtering vs. Trimming:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **Trimming:** We ***cut off the low-quality ends of the reads*** (e.g., “keep only the first 240 bases of the forward read”).\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **Filtering:** We discard an entire read pair if it doesn’t meet certain criteria (e.g., “if the read has more than 2 expected errors, throw it away”).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Extending Knowledge: Paired-End Reads**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data is “paired-end.” This means for every DNA fragment, the machine sequences it from both ends:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A **Forward Read (\\_R1\\_)** starts from one end.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A **Reverse Read (\\_R2\\_)** starts from the other end.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this so powerful for 16S?**  \n",
    "The V4 region we are sequencing is about 250 base pairs (bp) long. Our Illumina machine can generate reads that are, for example, 250bp long. This means our forward and reverse reads will **overlap** significantly in the middle.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a later step (Lesson 3), we will ***merge these overlapping reads***. ***This is a massive internal quality check. If the overlapping region of the forward and reverse reads do not perfectly agree, we know there was a sequencing error, and we can discard that read pair***. This dramatically increases the accuracy of our final data. **Our trimming decisions in this lesson must ensure that we leave enough of an overlap between the forward and reverse reads for this merging to work.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Practical Application: The Code in Chunks**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now begin writing our `01_dada2_pipeline.R` script.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Chunk 1: Setup and File Path Management**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** We start by loading the `dada2` library and creating sorted lists of our forward and reverse FASTQ files. It is absolutely critical that the ***forward and reverse reads are in the same corresponding*** order for the pipeline to work.\n",

    "\n",
    "-   **Verification:** Inspect the printed file lists. Confirm that F3D0_R1… is matched with F3D0_R2…, and so on for all samples. This confirms our file paths are correctly set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Chunk 2: Visualizing Read Quality**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** This is our first “Trust, but Verify” step. We will use the `plotQualityProfile` function to visualize the quality scores for our first few samples. This plot is the only way to make an informed decision about our trimming parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**codeR**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    # Plot the quality profile for the first two reverse reads\n",
    "    plotQualityProfile(fnRs[1:2])\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Action:** Run this chunk. Two plots will be generated in your RStudio “Plots” pane.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Interpretation and Verification:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **The x-axis** is the position in the read (base pair).\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **The y-axis** is the Phred Quality Score.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **The green line** is the median quality score at that position.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **The orange lines** are the 25th and 75th quartiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   You are **verifying** the expected quality decay. The forward read plot should show high quality (e.g., \\>Q30) that drops off around base 240-250. ***The reverse read plot will show a much sharper and earlier drop-off***, perhaps starting around base 160-170. This plot directly informs our next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Chunk 3: Filtering and Trimming**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Based on the quality plots, we will now choose our parameters and run the main filtering function, `filterAndTrim`. We will create a new sub-directory (filtered) to store the clean reads, ensuring we never overwrite our raw data.\n",

    "\n",
    "    # --- 3. Filter and Trim Reads ---\n",

    "    head(out)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Action:** Run this chunk. This is a key processing step and may take a few minutes. `dada2` is now reading every single sequence from your raw files, applying your trimming and filtering rules, and writing the clean reads to the new filtered folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Verification:** The out table is our proof. It shows a summary for each sample, with a column for reads.in (the number of raw reads we started with) and a column for reads.out (the number of reads that passed our filters). A good filtering step will ***retain a high percentage (e.g., \\>70%) of the reads***. If reads.out is zero or very low for any sample, it indicates a problem with that sample or that our filtering parameters were too aggressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lesson 2: Summary & Status Check**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Conceptually**, we understand that raw sequencing reads have variable quality, especially at the ends, and that paired-end reads must have sufficient overlap after trimming to be useful.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Lesson 3: The `dada2` Algorithm - Denoising and Inferring ASVs🥰**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** ***`To understand the conceptual shift from OTUs to ASVs, to learn how the DADA2 algorithm works, and to apply it to our filtered reads to generate a high-resolution feature table of Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs).`***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Core Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Old Way: OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units(操作单元分类))**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Older methods (like `QIIME 1, mothur`) used a ***clustering approach***. They would take all the sequencing reads and group them together based on a ***similarity threshold***, typically 97%.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Each cluster was called an **OTU**. The most abundant sequence within the cluster was chosen as the “representative sequence.”\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **The Problem:** This 97% threshold was ***arbitrary***. ***It incorrectly lumped together distinct species that had very similar 16S genes***, and, more importantly, ***it treated real biological variants and sequencing errors exactly the same***. It was impossible to tell them apart, leading to a loss of resolution and an inflation of diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The New Way: ASVs (Amplicon Sequence Variants(扩增子序列变体))**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   The `dada2` algorithm takes a completely different, more powerful approach called **denoising(去噪)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Instead of clustering similar reads, it aims to infer the **original, error-free biological sequences** that were in the sample before the PCR and sequencing errors were introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   These inferred, perfect sequences are called **ASVs**. ***Each ASV is unique and is treated as a distinct biological entity, resolved down to the single-nucleotide level***.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **The Power:** An ASV is a reusable, universal “label.” The ASV sequence for a specific Lactobacillus(乳酸杆菌) strain found in your mouse study will be the exact same ASV sequence found in a human study from a different lab, allowing for direct, high-resolution comparison across experiments. This was impossible with study-specific OTU clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **How the dada2 Algorithm Works (The Magic)**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  **Step 1: Learn the Error Rates.** This is the key innovation. The algorithm first looks at the abundance of all unique reads and their quality scores. ***It knows that a true biological sequence should be more abundant than a sequence that is just a one-off error***. ***By modeling the relationship between abundance and quality, it builds a highly accurate, sample-specific model of the sequencing error rates*** (e.g., “What is the probability that the machine reads a ‘G’ when the true base was an ‘A’, given a quality score of 30?”).\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.  **Step 2: Denoise by Partitioning.** For each unique read, the algorithm uses this error model to calculate the probability that it could have been generated from a more abundant “parent” sequence. It then “partitions(分区)” the reads, ***collapsing the likely error-reads into the true parent sequences they came from***.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.  **Step 3: Merge Paired-End Reads.** After denoising the forward and reverse reads independently, it merges them. This is a final, powerful quality check. If the denoised forward and reverse reads do not have a perfect overlap, the pair is discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4.  **Step 4: Remove Chimeras.** During PCR, two different DNA strands can sometimes get stuck together, creating an artificial “chimera(嵌合体)” sequence. ***The final step identifies and removes these chimeras, leaving us with a clean table of high-confidence ASVs***.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Practical Application: The Code in Chunks**\n",
    "\n",
    "We continue in our `01_dada2_pipeline.R` script.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Chunk 1: Learn the Error Rates**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** We will apply the first step of the `dada2` algorithm: building the error models. We do this independently for the forward and reverse reads. This is a computationally intensive step.\n",

    "-   **Conceptually**, we have made the crucial leap from noisy, clustered OTUs to high-resolution, denoised **ASVs**. We understand the logic of the `dada2` algorithm: it learns the specific error patterns in our data and uses that model to infer the original, error-free biological sequences.\n",

    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lesson 4: Taxonomic Assignment🤖**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** ***`To take our list of unique ASV sequences and assign a taxonomic classification (from Kingdom down to Genus, and sometimes Species) to each one by comparing it against a curated reference database.`***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Core Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The “Look-up” Problem:** We have a list of several hundred unique, error-free 16S V4 sequences (our ASVs). ***We now need to look them up to find out which known bacteria they belong to***.\n",
    "-   **The Need for a Reference Database:** To do this, we need a massive, curated database of known 16S sequences from well-characterized organisms. ***This database serves as our “phone book” or “encyclopedia.”***\n",
    "-   **Popular Reference Databases:**\n",
    "    -   **SILVA:** A very comprehensive, high-quality, and regularly updated database of ribosomal RNA genes. It is one of the most popular choices for modern microbiome analysis.\n",
    "    -   **Greengenes:** Another classic and widely used database, though it has not been updated as recently as SILVA.\n",
    "    -   **RDP (Ribosomal Database Project):** A database that provides a unique classification algorithm.\n",
    "    -   **Choice Matters:** The choice of database will influence your results. For this tutorial, we will use **SILVA**, as it is a common and robust choice.\n",
    "-   **The Algorithm (`assignTaxonomy`):** The `dada2` function `assignTaxonomy` uses a **naive Bayesian classifier**. You don’t need to know the deep math, but the concept is intuitive:\n",
    "    1.  It takes one of your ASV sequences.\n",
    "    2.  ***It compares “words” (short subsequences of length 8, called k-mers) from your ASV to the k-mers present in all the sequences in the reference database***.\n",
    "    3.  Based on which reference sequences share the most k-mers with your ASV, it calculates the probability (the “confidence”) that your ***ASV belongs to a certain taxonomic group at each level*** (Kingdom(界), Phylum(门), Class(纲), Order(目), Family(科), Genus(属)).\n",
    "    4.  It assigns the taxonomy down to the lowest level for which it has a high confidence (typically \\>80%).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Extending Knowledge: The Limits of Resolution**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Why does it stop at Genus?** The V4 region of the 16S gene is excellent for distinguishing between different genera (e.g., *Lactobacillus* vs. *Bifidobacterium*). However, ***for many types of bacteria, the V4 sequences of closely related species within the same genus are*** **identical or nearly identical**. The barcode simply isn’t variable enough to tell them apart reliably.\n",
    "-   **The “NA” Problem:** If the algorithm cannot assign a taxonomy at a certain level with high confidence, it will return an `NA` (Not Available). It is extremely common and **perfectly normal** to have many of your ASVs assigned to a Genus of `NA`. **This is not an error; it is the algorithm being honest about the limits of the data. It means “I am confident this is in the *Lachnospiraceae(毛螺菌)* family, but I cannot be sure which genus it is.”**\n",
    "-   **Assigning Species:** `dada2` has an extra function called `addSpecies` ***that can attempt to assign species by looking for perfect, exact matches to reference sequences***. This should be used ***with caution***, as it is only r***eliable for species that are well-defined by their V4 sequence***.\n",

    "\n",
    "-   **Conceptually**, we understand that taxonomic assignment is a “look-up” process that compares our ASV sequences to a reference database like SILVA.

    "### **Lesson 5: Creating the `phyloseq` Object🍱**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** ***To understand the conceptual brilliance of the `phyloseq` object and to combine our disparate(不同) data tables (ASV counts, taxonomy, sample metadata) into a single, cohesive, and powerful `phyloseq` object that will serve as the foundation for all our downstream analyses.***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Core Concepts: The Problem of “Data Wrangling” in Bioinformatics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before **`phyloseq`**, microbiome analysis in R was ***a messy and error-prone process***. A bioinformatician would have, at minimum, three separate data objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **The Count Table:** A matrix where rows are microbes (OTUs/ASVs) and columns are samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **The Taxonomy Table:** A matrix where rows are microbes and columns are taxonomic ranks (Kingdom, Phylum…).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **The Sample Metadata:** A data frame where rows are samples and columns are experimental variables (e.g., “Treatment”, “Age”, “Genotype”).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenge:** The bioinformatician was personally responsible for keeping these three tables **perfectly synchronized**.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If you filtered out a sample from the count table, you had to remember to also remove the corresponding row from the metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If you removed a low-abundance microbe from the count table, you had to remember to also remove its corresponding row from the taxonomy table.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Forgetting one of these steps would lead to mismatched data, incorrect plots, and invalid statistical results. This “data wrangling” was tedious and a major source of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. The phyloseq Solution: A Cohesive, Self-Aware Object**\n",
    "\n",
    "The creator of the `phyloseq` package, Paul McMurdie, solved this problem with a brilliant object-oriented design.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The `phyloseq` Object:** Think of a `phyloseq` object not as a table, but as a **smart container or a “lab notebook.”** You put your individual data tables into it once, at the very beginning. From that point on, the `phyloseq` object itself handles all the synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   If you use a `phyloseq` command to filter out a sample, the object automatically removes that sample from **both** the count table and the metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   If you use a `phyloseq` command to select only the “Firmicutes” phylum, the object automatically subsets **both** the count table and the taxonomy table, keeping them perfectly matched.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Components (or “Slots”):** A `phyloseq` object has several “slots” to hold different types of data. The three essential ones are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  **`otu_table`:** The ASV count table.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.  **`tax_table`:** The taxonomy table.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.  **`sample_data`:** The sample metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   It can also hold a phylogenetic tree(发育树) in a `phy_tree` slot, which is crucial for certain diversity metrics we will discuss later.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Power:** This design completely eliminates the class of “wrangling(争论·)” errors described above. It lets the scientist focus on the biological questions instead of the tedious task of data bookkeeping. It ensures that all analyses, subsets, and plots are internally consistent and valid.\n",

    "#### **1. Core Concepts: The Language of Ecology**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ecologists have two primary ways of thinking about diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept 1: Alpha Diversity (“Within-Sample” Diversity)**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Question:** How ***diverse*** is the microbial community within a single sample?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Analogy:** Imagine you are standing in a single forest patch (one sample). Alpha diversity tells you about the richness and evenness of the trees in that patch alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Key Metrics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  **Richness (e.g., “Observed ASVs”):** The simplest metric. It’s just a count of ***how many different species (ASVs) are present in the sample***. A sample with 100 ASVs is “richer” than one with 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.  **Evenness(均匀度) & Richness Combined (e.g., “Shannon” or “Simpson” indices(香农指数和辛普森指数)):** These are more sophisticated metrics. They consider both the number of species (richness) and their relative abundances (evenness). A community where 10 species each make up 10% of the community is considered more diverse than a community where 1 species makes up 91% and the other 9 species make up 1% each, even though their richness is the same. The **Shannon index** is the ***most*** ***common and is a good measure of overall diversity***.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept 2: Beta Diversity (“Between-Sample” Diversity)**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Question:** How different are the microbial communities between two or more samples?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Analogy:** Imagine you are comparing two different forest patches (two samples). Beta diversity is a single number that quantifies how dissimilar the tree communities are between those two patches.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Key Metrics (Dissimilarity Indices(差异指数)):** There are many ways to calculate this, but they all result in a “distance” or “dissimilarity” value. ***A value of 0 means the samples are identical; a value of 1 means they share no species.***\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  **Jaccard Distance (Unweighted):** This metric only cares about the **presence or absence** of species. It ignores abundance. It is useful for focusing on rare species.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.  **Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity (Weighted):** ***This is the most common and robust metric.*** It considers **both presence/absence and the relative abundance** of each species. It is more influenced by the dominant members of the community.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Visualization and Testing:** We calculate the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity between every possible pair of our samples, which results in a “distance matrix.” Since we can’t look at a giant matrix of numbers, we use **ordination methods** (like PCA’s cousin, **Principal Coordinates Analysis - PCoA**) to visualize this distance matrix in a 2D plot. We then use a statistical test called **PERMANOVA** to ask, “Is the average distance between samples within the same group (e.g., WT to WT) significantly smaller than the average distance between different groups (e.g., WT to KO)?”\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Practical Application: The Code in Chunks**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now write our code in the `02_phyloseq_analysis.R` script, starting with the `ps` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Chunk 1: Alpha Diversity Calculation and Plotting**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The `phyloseq` package makes calculating alpha diversity incredibly easy. We will use the `estimate_richness()` function to calculate several metrics at once and then plot the results using a boxplot to visually compare the diversity between our WT and KO groups.\n",

    "-   **Action:** Add this chunk to your script and run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Verification:** The `boxplot` is our first key result. You can visually inspect it. For example, do the Shannon diversity values for the KO group look consistently lower than for the WT group? This plot gives us our first hint of a biological difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Chunk 2: Alpha Diversity Statistical Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** A plot isn’t enough; we need a p-value. We will extract the alpha diversity values and perform a simple statistical test (a Wilcoxon rank-sum test, which is a non-parametric version of a t-test) to see if the observed difference is statistically significant.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Chunk 3: Beta Diversity Calculation and Visualization**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Now we’ll analyze the between-sample diversity. The workflow is: 1) calculate the Bray-Curtis distance matrix, 2) perform ordination (PCoA) on that matrix, and 3) create a plot to visualize the result. `phyloseq` streamlines(简化) this entire process.\n",

    "\n",
    "-   **Verification:** The PCoA plot is our proof. This is the direct analog to the PCA plot from our metabolomics lesson. A strong biological effect will be visible as a **clear separation or clustering** of the WT points away from the KO points. ***If the ellipses(椭圆) for the two groups do not overlap much, it’s a strong visual indicator that the overall community composition is different between the genotypes.***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Chunk 4: Beta Diversity Statistical Testing (PERMANOVA)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The PCoA plot is a visualization, not a statistical test. The formal test for a significant difference in community composition is a **PERMANOVA** (Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance). We use the `adonis2` function from the `vegan` package for this.\n",

    "-   **Action:** Run this final chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Verification:** The output table is our definitive proof. Look for the row corresponding to your variable (“Genotype”) and find its Pr(\\>F) value. This is the **p-value**. ***If it is less than 0.05, you have strong statistical evidence that the overall microbial community composition is significantly different between your WT and KO groups, validating what you saw in the PCoA plot.***\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lesson 6: Summary & Status Check**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Conceptually**, we have defined and distinguished between the two pillars of ecological diversity: **alpha diversity** (within-sample richness/evenness) and **beta diversity** (between-sample dissimilarity).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Practically**, we have used `phyloseq` and associated packages to calculate, visualize, and statistically test for differences in both alpha and beta diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Crucially**, we have followed the “Trust, but Verify” principle for each concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   For alpha diversity, we complemented our **boxplot visualization** with a **Wilcoxon test p-value**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   For beta diversity, we complemented our **PCoA plot visualization** with a **PERMANOVA p-value**.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Lesson 7: Differential Abundance Analysis🐼**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** ***`To use a statistically robust method to identify specific ASVs (or higher taxonomic ranks like Genus) that are significantly different in their relative abundance between our experimental groups (WT vs. KO).`***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Core Concepts: The Challenge of Compositional Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "As we just discussed, this is the most statistically nuanced part of the analysis. Let’s formalize why simple tests fail and how specialized tools solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Problem with Standard Tests (e.g., t-test, limma):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  **Compositionality & Library Size:** These tests assume the data is ***absolute and comparable*** on a raw scale. ***They are completely fooled by differences in sequencing depth (library size)***.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.  **Sparsity (Many Zeros):** Microbiome data is full of zeros. ***A specific microbe might be absent in one entire group***. This sparsity(稀疏性) breaks the statistical assumptions (like normality) of many standard tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.  **Highly Skewed Data:** The data is not a nice bell curve. It’s usually dominated by a few very abundant taxa and a long tail of rare taxa.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Solution: Specialized Models for Count Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   To solve this, we borrow powerful tools from the field of ***RNA-seq analysis(bulk)***, which faces the exact same problems (count data, library size issues, sparsity).\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   The leading tool for this is **DESeq2**. ***It is a gold standard for differential expression analysis in RNA-seq and has been shown to be very effective and robust for microbiome data as well***.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **How DESeq2 Works (The Magic):**\n",
    "\n",
    "        1.  **Normalization:** This is the key. DESeq2 has a brilliant internal normalization method. It calculates a “size factor” for each sample. ***It assumes that most microbes do not change between conditions and uses the median of ratios between samples to find the `sample-specific technical scaling factor(技术缩放因子)`***. It then uses this to correct the counts before any statistical testing. This effectively solves the “library size” problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "        2.  **Modeling the Data:** It uses a statistical model called the **Negative Binomial distribution**, which is perfectly suited for count data that is noisy and has many low values.\n",
    "\n",
    "        3.  **Statistical Testing:** It then performs a robust statistical test (the Wald test) on the normalized, modeled data to get a log2 fold change, a p-value, and an adjusted p-value for every single microbe.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Chunk 1: Install DESeq2 and Prepare the Data**\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Lesson 8: The Core Concepts of Shotgun Metagenomics🐞**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** To understand the fundamental principles of shotgun metagenomics, its key advantages and challenges, and the conceptual shift from analyzing a single gene to analyzing a catalog of *all* genes in the community.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Core Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **What is Shotgun Metagenomics?**\n",
    "    -   Instead of amplifying one specific gene (like 16S), this method involves ***taking the entire collection of DNA from a sample*** (the “metagenome”(宏基因组)), physically shattering(破碎) it into millions of small, random fragments, and then sequencing all of these fragments.\n",
    "    -   The result is a massive collection of sequencing reads that represent a random sampling of *all the genetic material* from *all the organisms* in the sample—bacteria, archaea, viruses, and even fungi(真菌).\n",
    "    -   **The Analogy:** If 16S analysis is taking a census of a city, shotgun metagenomics is like collecting every single page from every book in the city’s library, shredding them all, mixing them together, and then trying to figure out not only which books were there, but also what stories were written in them.\n",
    "-   **The Key Advantages (The “Why”):**\n",
    "    1.  **Functional Potential:** This is the #1 advantage. Because we sequence all the genes, we can identify the **functional potential** of the community. We can answer questions like: “Does this microbial community have the genes to produce butyrate(丁酸)?” or “Is the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes higher in the treated group?” This is impossible with 16S data.\n",
    "    2.  **Higher Taxonomic Resolution:** Since we have information from the entire genome, not just one small gene region, ***we can often distinguish between very closely related species and even different strains of the same species***.\n",
    "    3.  **Unbiased View:** It captures information from viruses, fungi, and other microbes that do not have the 16S gene, ***providing a more complete picture of the entire microbial ecosystem***.\n",
    "-   **The Central Challenge (The “How”):**\n",
    "    -   **Assembly:** The primary bioinformatics challenge is **metagenomic assembly**. We have millions of short, scrambled reads (like the shredded pages of the library books) coming from hundreds of different genomes. ***The goal of assembly is to computationally stitch these short reads back together into longer, contiguous sequences*** (called **“contigs”**), like taping the shredded pages back together to form sentences and paragraphs. This is a massive and complex puzzle.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Extending Knowledge: Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs)(宏基因组组装基因组)**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The ultimate goal of metagenomic assembly is to **not just create random contigs, but to group the contigs that belong to the *same original organism***.\n",
    "-   A **Metagenome-Assembled Genome (MAG)** is a collection of contigs that are computationally inferred to have come from a single, distinct microbial genome.\n",
    "-   **How it’s done:** After assembling contigs, bioinformaticians use properties like sequence composition (the pattern of A’s, T’s, C’s, and G’s) and read coverage depth across different samples to “bin” the contigs into putative genomes.\n",
    "-   **The Power of MAGs:** This is the holy grail of metagenomics. From a complex environmental sample, you can computationally reconstruct the entire genome of a previously unknown, uncultured bacterium. This allows you to discover novel organisms and their complete metabolic capabilities directly from the environment. Creating MAGs is an advanced topic, but it is the exciting frontier of the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Practical Application: A New Computational Environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "The sheer scale of shotgun data (often billions of reads per study) means that we typically cannot analyze it on a standard laptop using R alone. The upstream processing is almost always performed on a **High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster** ***using a series of powerful, command-line based bioinformatics tools.***\n",

    "    -   **The “How” (The Subtraction Method):** The standard method is to ***perform a mapping-based subtraction(基于映射的减法)***. We take all our QC’d reads and a***lign them against the host’s reference genome*** (e.g., the mouse mm10 genome). ***Any read that successfully maps to the host genome is discarded***.

    "-   **The Fundamental Problem:** We have millions of short reads (~150 bp each) that are like tiny, random snippets(小片段) of text from hundreds of different books (genomes), all mixed together. Our goal is to tape these snippets back together to reconstruct the original sentences and paragraphs (the contigs).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **How is this even possible? Overlap.** The only way to connect two reads is if they overlap. If Read A ends with …ATGC and Read B starts with ATGC…, we can infer that they belong next to each other. ***The assembler’s job is to find all of these overlaps among billions of possible pairs.***\n",
    "\n",
    "    When you’re dealing with **unknown genomes** (like in metagenomics), you **don’t have a reference** to align to. So instead of asking “Where does this read belong on a known genome?”, you’re asking:\n",

    "    1.  **Step 1: Shred(拆分) the Reads into k-mers.** The algorithm first breaks every single read into even smaller, overlapping “words” of a fixed size, k (e.g., k=21). These are called **k-mers**. For example, the sequence ATGCGT would be broken into the k-mers ATGCG, TGCGT.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.  **Step 2: Build the Graph.** It then builds a massive graph data structure. Each unique k-mer from our entire dataset becomes a **node** in the graph. An **edge** is drawn from one node to another if those two k-mers overlap and were found next to each other in the original reads.\n",

    "-   **The Metagenomic Challenge:** Why is this harder than assembling a single genome? Because ***reads from different species can have similar sequences*** (e.g., conserved housekeeping genes). This creates “bubbles” and “tangles” in the de Bruijn graph where paths diverge and converge, making it hard for the assembler to find a single, unambiguous path. ***This is why metagenomic assemblies are often more fragmented (resulting in more, shorter contigs) than single-genome assemblies***.\n",

    "-   **The “How” (Prodigal):** We use a specialized tool like **Prodigal** (PROkaryotic Dynameic Programming Genefinding ALgorithm(原核生物动态编程基因查找算法)). ***It is incredibly good at finding genes in bacterial and archaeal DNA***. It works by scanning the contigs for statistical signals that indicate a gene, such as:\n",

    "    1.  **Open Reading Frames (ORFs):** Long stretches of DNA that start with a “start codon” (like ATG) and end with a “stop codon” (like TAA, TAG, or TGA) without any stop codons in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.  **Ribosome Binding Sites (RBS):** Specific sequence patterns (like the Shine-Dalgarno sequence) that appear just upstream of a start codon, which is where the ribosome binds to start making a protein.\n",

This FASTA file contains all the reconstructed contigs. A crucial verification step is to run a tool like `QUAST` on this file, which generates a rich report on the assembly statistics (e.g., N50, number of contigs, total assembly size). ***A good N50 value (meaning half of the assembly is in contigs of this size or larger) is a key indicator of a successful assembly***.\n",

    "-   **Action:** Run this command. `Prodigal` is very fast and will likely finish in a few minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Prodigal doesn’t need a reference genome because it relies on **intrinsic signals** within the DNA sequence itself. Here’s what it looks for:\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### 1. **Start and Stop Codons(密码子)**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Genes begin with a **start codon** (usually ATG) and end with a **stop codon** (TAA, TAG, or TGA).\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Prodigal ***scans for these patterns and evaluates the likelihood that the region between them is a real gene.***\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### 2. **Coding Potential**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Real genes tend to have **non-random codon usage**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Prodigal uses **Markov models** to detect regions that statistically resemble known coding sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### 3. **Ribosome Binding Sites (RBS)**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   In prokaryotes, genes often have an RBS upstream of the start codon.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Prodigal looks for these motifs to strengthen its prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### 4. **Reading Frame Consistency**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   It checks whether the sequence maintains a consistent reading frame (no premature stop codons).\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   This helps distinguish real genes from random ORFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### 5. **Metagenomic Mode (**`-p meta`**)**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   In metagenomic mode, Prodigal relaxes some assumptions (like gene density or operon structure) to handle fragmented and diverse contigs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ***Even though you don’t know which organism a contig comes from, the rules of gene structure are surprisingly `conserved` across bacteria and archaea. Prodigal leverages these rules to make educated predictions.***\n",
    "\n",
    "    ***Think of it like this: even if you don’t know the language, you can often guess where sentences begin and end based on punctuation and rhythm. Prodigal does something similar—but with DNA.***\n",

    "***But the most important thing is Prokaryotes(原核生物) do not have exons***\n",

    "\n",
    "-   **Conceptually**, we have tackled the most difficult part of metagenomics. We understand the logic of **de Bruijn graph assembly** for reconstructing contigs from short reads, and the principles of **gene prediction** for identifying ORFs and other signals in those contigs.\n",

    "-   **Practically**, we have used two gold-standard, command-line tools (`MEGAHIT` and `Prodigal`) to perform these computationally intensive tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Crucially**, we have followed the “Trust, but Verify” principle by defining clear verification steps for each stage: using `QUAST` to check assembly quality and using simple grep commands to confirm that we have successfully generated our metagene catalog.\n",

    "We have successfully processed our raw reads into a massive, annotated list of all the protein-coding genes present in our microbial community. This is a monumental achievement.

    "## **🎃Part 4: Downstream - Functional and Taxonomic Analysis🧉**\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lesson 11: Taxonomic Profiling🛫**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** ***`To take our raw, clean microbial reads for each sample and rapidly determine the taxonomic identity and relative abundance of the organisms present, from the Kingdom down to the Species and even Strain level.`***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Core Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Challenge:** How do you identify an organism from a random, 150 bp fragment of its DNA? Unlike 16S, ***we don’t have a universal barcode. Any read could come from anywhere in the genome***.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The “k-mer” Based Solution:** The modern solution is incredibly fast and clever. It relies on the idea that ***every microbial genome has a “fingerprint” composed of the unique short DNA “words” (k-mers) it contains.***\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **Step 1: Build a Massive Database.** Scientists pre-process thousands of reference genomes from public databases (like NCBI RefSeq). For every genome, they create a comprehensive list of all the k-mers (e.g., all 31-base-pair sequences) it contains. ***This huge database maps millions of unique k-mers to the specific genomes they came from.***\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **Step 2: The Kraken2 Algorithm.** A tool like **Kraken2** is a highly efficient implementation of this idea. When you give it one of your sequencing reads, it does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "        1.  It breaks the read down into its constituent k-mers.\n",
    "\n",
    "        2.  For each k-mer, ***it looks it up in its massive database to find which genomes contain that k-mer.***\n",
    "\n",
    "        3.  It finds the “Lowest Common Ancestor” (LCA)(最低共同祖先). If some k-mers in a read match E. coli strain A and others match E. coli strain B, Kraken2 won’t guess. It will confidently assign the read to the E. coli species level, which is the lowest taxonomic level that is unambiguously supported by the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **The Output:** Kraken2 processes millions of reads per minute. For each read, ***it assigns a taxonomic ID***. It then generates a summary report that tells you, for each sample, the percentage and number of reads that were assigned to each taxon (e.g., 15% Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, 10% Akkermansia muciniphila, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Why use reads instead of contigs?** We use the pre-assembly reads for this because the process is very fast and it gives us the most sensitive view of the community, including low-abundance organisms that may not have assembled well into large contigs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Practical Application: The Command-Line Workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use `Kraken2` for classification and a helper tool called Bracken to improve the accuracy of our abundance estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Chunk 1: Download the `Kraken2` Database**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** This is a crucial, one-time setup step. The Kraken2 database is very large (many gigabytes) and contains the pre-processed k-mer information for thousands of reference genomes. ***You would typically download a standard, pre-built database***.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "# --- 6. Taxonomic Profiling with Kraken2 ---\n",
    "\n",
    "# This is a one-time command to download a pre-built database.\n",
    "# We will use the \"Standard\" database which includes RefSeq bacteria, archaea, and viral genomes.\n",
    "# The database will be stored in a directory called 'kraken2_db'.\n",
    "kraken2-build --standard --db kraken2_db --threads 16\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Action:** You would run a command like this once on your HPC cluster. It will take a long time to download and build. For all future projects, you can simply point to this same database directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Chunk 2: Run `Kraken2` on All Samples**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Now we will loop through our cleaned, host-removed read files and run `Kraken2` on each one. The output will be a report file for each sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "# Set path to our database\n",
    "KRAKEN_DB=\"kraken2_db\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Loop through our microbial read files for each sample\n",
    "for SAMPLE in Control_1 Control_2 HFD_1 HFD_2; do # A loop for all samples\n",
    "\n",
    "  echo \"Running Kraken2 on sample: $SAMPLE\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  kraken2 --db $KRAKEN_DB --threads 16 --paired \\\n",
    "    --report 05-taxonomy/${SAMPLE}.report \\\n",

    "    02-host_removed/${SAMPLE}.microbial_2.fastq.gz > 05-taxonomy/${SAMPLE}.kraken2_output\n",
    "\n",
    "done\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Action:** Run this loop in your terminal. `Kraken2` will process each sample, which can take some time depending on the file size.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Verification:** Inspect one of the output report files (`Control_1.report`). It’s a text file with a clear, tab-delimited format. Each line represents a taxon, and the columns show the percentage of reads assigned to that taxon, the number of reads, and its taxonomic rank (e.g., ‘S’ for species, ‘G’ for genus). This confirms the run was successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Chunk 3: Refine Abundances with Bracken**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Kraken2 is ***very conservative*** and often assigns reads to a higher taxonomic level (like Genus) if it’s not certain about the species. **`Bracken`** (Bayesian Reestimation of Abundance with KrakEN) is a post-processing tool that uses statistical methods to ***distribute those higher-level reads down to the most likely species, giving a more accurate species-level abundance estimate***.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "# Run Bracken on the Kraken2 report files to get better species-level estimates\n",
    "for SAMPLE in Control_1 Control_2 HFD_1 HFD_2; do\n",

    "\n",
    "  bracken -d $KRAKEN_DB -i 05-taxonomy/${SAMPLE}.report \\\n",
    "    -o 05-taxonomy/${SAMPLE}.bracken \\\n",
    "    -r 150 # Specify the read length\n",
    "done\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Action:** Run this loop. `Bracken` is very fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Verification:** Inspect one of the new \\*`.bracken` output files. It will look similar to the `Kraken2` report but with more reads assigned at the species level. This is your refined taxonomic profile for that sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Chunk 4: Combine all reports into a single table**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The final step is to combine the individual sample reports from `Bracken` into a single, master abundance table (Species by Samples) that we can use for downstream statistical analysis in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "# We can use a helper script often provided with KrakenTools to do this\n",
    "# This command merges all the Bracken output files into one abundance matrix\n",
    "combine_bracken_outputs.py --files 05-taxonomy/*.bracken -o 05-taxonomy/taxonomic_abundance_matrix.tsv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Action:** Run this command.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Verification:** The proof is the final output file: ***`taxonomic_abundance_matrix.tsv`***. This is a clean, tab-separated table. The rows are species, the columns are your samples, and the cells contain the estimated read counts. This is the **direct analog** of the `seqtab.nochim` table from our 16S pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lesson 11: Summary & Status Check**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Conceptually**, we understand the power of the k-mer based approach for rapid and sensitive taxonomic classification of shotgun reads. We know that Kraken2 performs the initial classification and Bracken refines the abundance estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Practically**, we have used a command-line workflow to download a reference database, run Kraken2 and Bracken on all our samples, and combine the results into a single, unified abundance table.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Crucially**, we have followed the “Trust, but Verify” principle by inspecting the intermediate report files and by confirming that our final output is a clean, well-formatted abundance matrix ready for the next stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lesson 12: Functional Annotation😏**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** ***`To take our massive list of predicted protein sequences (the metagene catalog) and assign a biological function to each gene. We will then use this information to create a functional profile for each of our samples, quantifying the abundance of different biological pathway`***s.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Core Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The “Why”:** The microbial community in our sample acts as a single, complex metabolic engine. While knowing the names of the species is important, ***it’s often more powerful to know what biochemical functions the entire engine is capable of performing***. For example, two different gut communities might be composed of entirely different species, but they might both have a high abundance of genes for digesting fiber. The function is conserved even if the species are different. This is the level of insight we want to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The “How” - Homology-Based Annotation(基于同源性的注释):** The process is conceptually similar to a BLAST search, but performed on a massive scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  **Start with the Metagene Catalog:** We have our `predicted_proteins.faa` file from `Prodigal`, which contains millions of protein sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.  **Compare to a Functional Database:** We ***compare each of our predicted protein sequences against a massive, curated database of proteins with known functions.***\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.  **Transfer by Homology:** If one of our unknown proteins is ***highly similar in sequence to a known protein in the database*** (i.e., they are “homologs”), ***we infer that our protein likely has the same or a very similar function***. We “transfer” the annotation from the known protein to our predicted gene.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Key Functional Databases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes):** The `gold standard` for pathway analysis. Each protein in KEGG is assigned a “K number” (e.g., K00844 for hexokinase(己糖激酶), and these ***K numbers are organized into well-defined metabolic pathway maps***. Annotating against KEGG is the most common goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **eggNOG (evolutionary genealogy of genes: Non-supervised Orthologous Groups):** A database that groups genes into “orthologous groups” based on their evolutionary relationships. It provides a very broad functional classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **CAZy (Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes Database):** A highly specialized database focused just on enzymes that build, modify, or break down carbohydrates. It’s essential for studies involving fiber digestion, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Final Output:** After annotating all of our genes, we need to create a **functional abundance table**. To do this, we need to know how many reads from each sample map back to each gene. We perform a mapping step:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  We align the raw reads from each sample against our metagene catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.  We count how many reads from Sample A map to Gene 1, Gene 2, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.  We can then ***sum the counts for all the genes that were annotated with the same function*** (e.g., all genes with K number K00844).\n",
    "\n",
    "    4.  The final result is a table ***where rows are functions*** (e.g., KEGG Orthology groups or Pathways) ***and columns are our samples, with the cells containing the (normalized) counts***.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Practical Application: The Command-Line Workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a multi-step, computationally intensive process. We will use a highly optimized tool called `MMseqs2` for the homology search, as it is much faster than traditional `BLAST`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Chunk 1: Annotate Genes against a Functional Database**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** We will take our predicted protein sequences and search them against the KEGG database using `MMseqs2`. This will create a table that links our gene IDs to the KEGG Orthology (KO) IDs they match.\n",

    "-   **The Beautiful Simplicity:** The most important concept to grasp is that, despite the vastly different and more complex upstream processing, the **final output matrices from shotgun metagenomics are conceptually identical to the ASV table from our 16S pipeline.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **Taxonomic Table:** Rows are taxa (Species), columns are samples, cells are counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **Functional Table:** Rows are functions (KEGG Orthologs), columns are samples, cells are counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Implication:** This means we do not need to learn a completely new set of downstream statistical tools. We can apply the **exact same powerful and robust workflow** that we have already mastered. This workflow includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  **Creating a `phyloseq` object** for easy data handling and exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.  **Calculating alpha and beta diversity** to assess community-level changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.  **Using `DESeq2` for differential abundance testing** to find the specific features (whether taxa or functions) that are significantly different between our groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Power of Integration:** The true power of shotgun data comes from performing this analysis on both tables. This allows us to connect the two views of the microbiome. For example, we might find that the **species** Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is significantly depleted in the high-fat diet group, AND that the **function** “butyrate production pathway” is also significantly depleted. Since F. prausnitzii is a famous butyrate producer, we have now linked a taxonomic change to a functional consequence, creating a much more compelling biological story.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Practical Application: The R Workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now be working in R, in a new script. This workflow will look remarkably familiar.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Action:** In RStudio, create a new script in your scripts folder named `02_shotgun_analysis.R`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Chunk 1: Load Data and Create `phyloseq` Objects**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** We will load our two final abundance matrices and our sample metadata. Then, we will create two separate `phyloseq` objects: one for the taxonomic analysis and one for the functional analysis.\n",

    "### **Grand Conclusion of the Entire Microbiome Curriculum**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have completed the full journey through both major methods of microbiome analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **16S Analysis:** We learned it is a powerful and cost-effective method for getting a **community census** (“who is there”). We mastered the modern, ASV-based `dada2` workflow for upstream processing and the `phyloseq` ecosystem for downstream ecological analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Shotgun Metagenomics:** We then advanced to the more comprehensive shotgun method, which provides a **functional blueprint** (“what can they do”). We learned about the formidable upstream bioinformatics challenges on the command line (QC, host removal, assembly, gene prediction) and saw how the downstream analysis converges, allowing us to apply the same robust statistical tools to both the taxonomic and functional profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Final Integrated Hypothesis:**  \n",
    "By combining the results from this last lesson, you can now form a truly powerful and complete hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "“***`A high-fat diet significantly alters the gut microbial community structure in mice (Taxonomic PERMANOVA, p<0.05). This shift is characterized by a significant depletion of the species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (DESeq2, padj<0.1). Functionally, this corresponds to a significant depletion of genes in the butyrate production pathway (e.g., KO K00922; DESeq2, padj<0.1), a key anti-inflammatory metabolite. This suggests that the detrimental effects of a high-fat diet may be mediated, in part, by the loss of key butyrate-producing species and their associated functions.`***”\n",
    "\n",
    "That is an outstanding question. You have successfully learned the “standard pipeline,” which is the essential foundation for any microbiome study. Now you are asking the question that a real researcher asks: **“What else can I do? What are the deeper, more interesting questions I can ask of this rich dataset?”**\n",
    "\n",
    "The downstream analyses we performed (diversity, differential abundance) are just the beginning. They tell you *what* changed. The more advanced analyses we will discuss now help you understand *how* and *why*, and allow you to explore the data from many different creative angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s structure this as a menu of advanced downstream research avenues, extending the knowledge from our previous lessons。\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "# **🫤A Menu of Advanced Downstream Microbiome Analyses🤤**\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Category 1: Deeper Ecological Patterns and Community Structure🥵**\n",
    "\n",
    "*These analyses go beyond simple beta diversity to understand the relationships* between\\* microbes.\\*\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Co-occurrence Network Analysis**\n",
    "    -   **The Question:** Which microbes are consistently ***found together*** (“friends”) and which are ***never found*** ***together*** (“foes”) across my samples? Do these relationships change between my Control and High-Fat Diet groups?\n",
    "    -   **The Logic:** You calculate the ***correlation*** (e.g., SparCC, Spearman) between the abundance of every microbe and every other microbe. ***A strong positive correlation implies a potential synergistic or co-dependent relationship. A strong negative correlation implies competition or niche exclusion(利基排斥).***\n",
    "    -   **The Output:** A ***network graph where microbes are nodes and significant correlations are edges***. This can reveal “keystone species” (highly connected nodes) or “guilds” (tightly clustered groups of microbes that may perform a similar function).\n",
    "    -   **Tools:** R packages like `SpiecEasi`, `NetCoMi`.\n",
    "2.  **Longitudinal Analysis (Time-Series Data)**\n",
    "    -   **The Question:** If my experiment ***took place over time*** (e.g., samples taken every week), how does the community change? How stable is it? How does it respond to a perturbation(干扰) (like a course of antibiotics) and does it recover?\n",
    "    -   **The Logic:** Instead of just comparing two static groups, you use statistical models that account for the time component. ***This allows you to analyze trajectories of change***.\n",
    "    -   **The Output:** Plots showing how diversity or the abundance of specific microbes changes over time. You can identify microbes that are “early responders” vs. “late responders.”\n",
    "    -   **Tools:** R packages like `lme4` (for linear mixed-effects models), `metageNRA`.\n",
    "3.  **Source Tracking Analysis**\n",
    "    -   **The Question:** Where did the microbes in my samples come from? For example, in a study of a baby’s gut microbiome, how much of it came from the mother’s gut, the mother’s skin, or the hospital environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **The Logic:** You provide a set of “source” samples (e.g., mother’s skin) and “sink” samples (e.g., baby’s gut). The algorithm uses a statistical model to estimate the proportion of the community in each sink sample that can be attributed to each source.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **The Output:** A bar chart showing the breakdown of microbial sources for each of your samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **Tools:** R packages like `FEAST`, `SourceTracker`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Category 2: Advanced Functional and Genomic Analysis (Shotgun Specific)🤨**\n",
    "\n",
    "*These analyses leverage the unique power of shotgun data to go beyond just pathway names.*\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Metagenome-Assembled Genome (MAG) Analysis**\n",
    "    -   **The Question:** ***Can I reconstruct the full genomes of the most important (or even novel) bacteria in my samples?*** What unique functional capabilities do these specific organisms have?\n",
    "    -   **The Logic:** As we discussed, this involves “binning” your assembled contigs into putative genomes (MAGs). ***Once you have a high-quality MAG, it’s like having the complete blueprint for that organism.***\n",
    "    -   **The Output:** You can run specialized analyses on each MAG to find, for example, antibiotic resistance gene clusters, pathways for producing novel antibiotics or vitamins (`antiSMASH`), or their complete metabolic map. This is a discovery-driven analysis.\n",
    "2.  **Strain-Level Analysis**\n",
    "    -   **The Question:** I see *E. coli* is abundant in both my Control and High-Fat Diet groups. But is it the *exact same strain* of *E. coli*, or have different strains taken over?\n",
    "    -   **The Logic:** ***This requires very high-resolution tools that look at the pattern of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)*** within the genomes of specific species.\n",
    "    -   **The Output:** ***A profile of the different strains present in each sample***. This is critical for epidemiological studies (tracking an infection) or for understanding if functional differences are occurring at the sub-species level.\n",
    "    -   **Tools:** `StrainPhlAn`, `inStrain`, `PanPhlAn`.\n",
    "3.  **Metabolic Pathway Reconstruction**\n",
    "    -   **The Question:** Instead of just getting a list of enriched KEGG pathways, can I build a complete, community-wide metabolic model? Can I predict which metabolites the community should be able to produce or consume?\n",
    "    -   **The Logic:** Tools like `HUMAnN` (The HMP Unified Metabolic Analysis Network) are designed for this. ***They not only identify which pathways are present but also how complete they are and which species are contributing to each step.***\n",
    "    -   **The Output:** A highly detailed profile of community-wide metabolic potential that can be directly linked to metabolomics data.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Category 3: Multi-omics Integration and Predictive Modeling🫡**\n",
    "\n",
    "*This is the frontier, where you connect the microbiome to other data types to build a holistic, systems-level understanding.*\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Microbiome + Metabolomics Integration**\n",
    "    -   **The Question:** We found that the species *F. prausnitzii* went down and the metabolite butyrate also went down. Are these events statistically linked?\n",
    "    -   **The Logic:** ***You use correlation analysis (e.g., Spearman correlation) to build a network that connects specific microbes to specific metabolites.***\n",
    "    -   **The Output:** A “multi-omic” network that might show a strong positive correlation between the abundance of *F. prausnitzii* and the concentration of butyrate, providing a strong mechanistic hypothesis.\n",
    "    -   **Tools:** R packages like `mixOmics`.\n",
    "2.  **Microbiome + Host Transcriptomics Integration**\n",
    "    -   **The Question:** ***How did the host’s gut cells respond to the change in the microbiome?***\n",
    "    -   **The Logic:** You correlate the abundance of specific microbes with the expression levels of host genes (from an RNA-seq experiment on the same samples).\n",
    "    -   **The Output:** ***You might find that the abundance of an inflammatory bacterium is strongly correlated with the upregulation of host immune response genes*** (like interleukins(白细胞介素) or TNF-alpha), demonstrating the direct impact of the microbiome on the host.\n",
    "3.  **Machine Learning and Biomarker Discovery**\n",
    "    -   **The Question:** ***Can I use the microbiome profile to predict if a person is healthy or has a disease? Can I identify a small panel of microbes that could serve as a diagnostic biomarker?***\n",
    "    -   **The Logic:** You use your microbiome data (either taxonomic or functional profiles) as “features” to train a machine learning model (e.g., ***Random Forest, LASSO regression***). You train the model on a “training set” of samples and then test its predictive accuracy on a separate “testing set.”\n",
    "    -   **The Output:** A predictive model and a measure of its accuracy (e.g., an AUC curve). ***The model can also report which microbes were the most important “features” for making the prediction, revealing your top biomarker candidates.***\n",
    "\n",
    "This menu of downstream analyses shows that our standard pipeline is really just the entry point. The real power and excitement come from using the processed data to explore these deeper ecological, functional, and integrative questions."
